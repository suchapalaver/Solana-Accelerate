# Creating an anchor client

See <https://github.com/brimigs/accelerate-bootcamp?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-an-anchor-client>

There has been a solana program deployed on devnet with this address: `5Couhd2qWo7v3L8LR3Q4daDPdFyJpV8MNqi3wkzNWGvu`

The Solana program allows you to vote on a given topic.

A front end was not created for this program so you will need to create an anchor client to enable to vote.

Make sure you cast your vote with the devnet address you used previously.

For reference, [here](https://github.com/solana-developers/developer-bootcamp-2024/tree/main/project-1-favorites) is the source code for the favorites voting app.
